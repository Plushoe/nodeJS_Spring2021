<h1>Hello there!</h1>

<p>This is a portfolio-like website written for an elective in NodeJS, during the spring semester 2021.</p>
<p>Click the links in the navbar to see previous projects I've worked on, <br/>write me and email, and of course see what I'm a bit about.</p>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I study computer science at KEA. The part I find the most enjoyable about CS is<br/>problem solving. I love backend stuff and tough code!</p>
<p>As you may can see, UI isn't my strong suit, but I'm learning :)</p>
